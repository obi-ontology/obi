Primers for the assay were designed in such a way that they amplified all the alleles of a particular HLA type (HLA-B or HLA-C) as well as the amplicon containing the polymorphic region of interest. Two probes were designed with a single mismatch between them. Each probe bound only one group of alleles and was labeled with either 6FAM or VIC fluorescent dye at its 5_ end. The 3_ end of the probes contained a quencher. For KIR2DL1 functional allele typing, the probe was designed based on a single-nucleotide mismatch at amino acid position 245 in the mature protein. A universal primer was designed that could specifically amplify all the alleles of KIR2DL1.The SNP assay was run on the HT7900 using the same protocol as described for KIR ligand typing. Results showed that 20 individuals had only arginine at amino acid position 245 of KIR2DL1, 5 were heterozygous for arginine and cysteine, and 1 had only cysteine in that position.Thus, this approach was useful not only for the identification of functional groups of KIR alleles, but also for determining the presence of the KIR gene itself."

OBI:9999994	chromium release assay			An in vitro cell killing assay in which radioactive chromium is absorbed by cells and released into supernatant when the cells die. The amount of radioactivity measured in the supernatant is a proxy for the number of cells that have died.		"Autologous EBV-transformed B-LCL were used as target cells for the influenza virus-specific CTL assays. Equal volumes of target and effector cells were added to triplicate wells of 96-well tissue culture plates, and 1:2 serial dilutions of effectors were made, producing effector-to-target (E:T) ratios of 100:1, 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1. After a 4-h incubation of the effector cells with the target cells, supernatants were collected following brief centrifugation and transferred to polystyrene tubes to be counted with the LKB 1272 Clinigamma counter (Wallac). Percent specific killing was determined with the following equation: (experimental 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release)/(maximum 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release) x 100."
