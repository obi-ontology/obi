The premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription. The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.	url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hybrid_screening	Strong FANCA/FANCG but weak FANCA/FANCC interaction in the yeast 2-hybrid system.

In parallel, a library of randomized oligonucleotides representing potential TF target sequences, is cloned into a separate vector containing the selectable genes HIS3 and URA3. If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively. At the end of the process, positive clones are sequenced and examined with motif-finding tools in order to resolve the favoured DNA target sequence	url:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_one-hybrid_system	A systematic characterization of factors that regulate Drosophila segmentation via a bacterial one-hybrid system.

PMID:9491555	On-line coupled immunoaffinity chromatography-reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (IAC-HPLC) with detection by quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry using a particle beam interface has been developed for the determination of the steroids, dexamethasone and flumethasone. HEMA (polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate) was evaluated as a support material for the anti-dexamethasone antibodies used in IAC. Antibody cross-reactivity and non-specific binding have been investigated for the HEMA bound anti-dexamethasone IAC column. The on-line IAC-HPLC-MS determination of dexamethasone and flumethasone in post-administration equine urine samples showed precisions (R.S.D.) of 8.0 and 7.1%, respectively, with limits of detection in the range 3-4 ng/ml.

OBI:0002117	whole genome sequencing assay			WGS	A DNA sequencing assay that intends to provide information about the sequence of an entire genome of an organism.	PMID:25827230|PMID:23095910	WGS permits comprehensive sequencing of introns and exons, whereas whole exome sequencing (WES) allows deeper sequencing of exonic regions at a lower cost. Due to the large number of genetic variants found in each genome, it is necessary to use filtering approaches to distinguish deleterious from benign variants. WES has been used successfully to identify novel genetic causes of primary immunodeficiency. Complex structural variations and non-Mendelian disorders remain challenges for WGS.

OBI:0002118	exome sequencing assay			WES	A DNA sequencing assay that intends to provide information about the sequence of the protein coding components of a genome (exons).	PMID:25827230	DNA was extracted from the Ficoll pellet of blood taken from congenital asplenia patients. Unamplified, high-molecular weight, RNase-treated genomic DNA (4_6 _g) was used for whole exome sequencing (WES) with the use of Agilent 71 Mb (V4 + UTR) singlesample capture and an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Sequencing was carried out so as to obtain 30_ coverage from 2 _ 100-bp paired-end reads. We used the Annovar tool (25) to annotate the resulting highquality (HQ) variants. In the regions targeted by WES capture (81.5% of the consensus coding genome), the mean numbers of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) detected per sample were 84,192 and13,325, respectively. After filtering, a mean of 74,398 (95.3%) high-quality (HQ) SNVs and 9,033 (70.6%) HQ indels were called. A mean of 105 coding HQ SNVs and 32 indels was identified.

OBI:0002121	killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor typing assay			KIR typing	A genotyping assay in which the alleles of genes encoding for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors are determined.	PMID:21239231	DNA was isolated from PBMCs from healthy donors.The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay was performed on an HT7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) following the allelic discrimination assay protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers for the assay were designed in such a way that they amplified all the alleles of a particular HLA type (HLA-B or HLA-C) as well as the amplicon containing the polymorphic region of interest. Two probes were designed with a single mismatch between them. Each probe bound only one group of alleles and was labeled with either 6FAM or VIC fluorescent dye at its 5_ end. The 3_ end of the probes contained a quencher. For KIR2DL1 functional allele typing, the probe was designed based on a single-nucleotide mismatch at amino acid position 245 in the mature protein. A universal primer was designed that could specifically amplify all the alleles of KIR2DL1.The SNP assay was run on the HT7900 using the same protocol as described for KIR ligand typing. Results showed that 20 individuals had only arginine at amino acid position 245 of KIR2DL1, 5 were heterozygous for arginine and cysteine, and 1 had only cysteine in that position.Thus, this approach was useful not only for the identification of functional groups of KIR alleles, but also for determining the presence of the KIR gene itself.

PMID:27516207|PMC:2628004	Blood samples from Holstein-Friesian heifer calves were used to isolate white blood cell (WBC) pellets, from which total RNA was extracted using Tri-reagent and cDNA generated using a Reverse Transcription Kit, both_ according to the manufacturers? instructions. An alignment of sequences of known bovine MHCI gene cDNAs, as presented in the IPD-MHC database (May 2014), was used to design a series of 3_ (for) and 5_ (rev) pan-MHCI primers. cDNA from individual animals was subject to PCR amplification in two separate reactions using either the For1/Rev2 or the For3/Rev1 primer pairs. For each sample primers using a unique combination of MID tags were used to allow subsequent de-multiplexing of the sequence data. PCRs were conducted using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR kit. Following amplification, 5?_l of PCR products from each sample were pooled, purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads and run on a 1.5?% agarose gel. Bands of the appropriate size_ were extracted and purified using the Qiagen Gel extraction kit. Libraries were submitted to Edinburgh Genomics where after standard quality control procedures they underwent 300 base paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq v3. Data were separated into reads generated from For1Rev2 and For3Rev1 primer pairs, generating separate datasets for up to 192 samples. Within each sample, reads were clustered into unique variants which were subsequently compared using BLAST against a database of the previously identified bovine MHCI sequences. This process identified >140 novel classical MHCI genes and defined 62 novel MHCI haplotypes, dramatically expanding the known bovine MHCI repertoire.

OBI:9999994	chromium release assay				An in vitro cell killing assay in which radioactive chromium is absorbed by cells and released into supernatant when the cells die. The amount of radioactivity measured in the supernatant is a proxy for the number of cells that have died.		Autologous EBV-transformed B-LCL were used as target cells for the influenza virus-specific CTL assays. Equal volumes of target and effector cells were added to triplicate wells of 96-well tissue culture plates, and 1:2 serial dilutions of effectors were made, producing effector-to-target (E:T) ratios of 100:1, 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1. After a 4-h incubation of the effector cells with the target cells, supernatants were collected following brief centrifugation and transferred to polystyrene tubes to be counted with the LKB 1272 Clinigamma counter (Wallac). Percent specific killing was determined with the following equation: (experimental 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release)/(maximum 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release) x 100.
