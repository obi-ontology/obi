OBI:0004001	randomized clinical trial	randomized clinical trial				A clinical trial in which the participants are divided by chance into separate groups that compare different treatments or other interventions. Using chance to divide people into groups means that the groups will be similar and that the effects of the treatments they receive can be compared more fairly. At the time of the trial, it is not known which treatment is best.	https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/randomized-clinical-trial		Sebastian Duesing			Charles Tapley Hoyt	https://github.com/obi-ontology/obi/issues/1891	subclass	clinical trial
