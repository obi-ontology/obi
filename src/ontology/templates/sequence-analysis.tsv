Primers for the assay were designed in such a way that they amplified all the alleles of a particular HLA type (HLA-B or HLA-C) as well as the amplicon containing the polymorphic region of interest. Two probes were designed with a single mismatch between them. Each probe bound only one group of alleles and was labeled with either 6FAM or VIC fluorescent dye at its 5_ end. The 3_ end of the probes contained a quencher. For KIR2DL1 functional allele typing, the probe was designed based on a single-nucleotide mismatch at amino acid position 245 in the mature protein. A universal primer was designed that could specifically amplify all the alleles of KIR2DL1.The SNP assay was run on the HT7900 using the same protocol as described for KIR ligand typing. Results showed that 20 individuals had only arginine at amino acid position 245 of KIR2DL1, 5 were heterozygous for arginine and cysteine, and 1 had only cysteine in that position.Thus, this approach was useful not only for the identification of functional groups of KIR alleles, but also for determining the presence of the KIR gene itself."

"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27516207, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628004/"	"Blood samples from Holstein-Friesian heifer calves were used to isolate white blood cell (WBC) pellets, from which total RNA was extracted using Tri-reagent and cDNA generated using a Reverse Transcription Kit, both  according to the manufacturers? instructions. An alignment of sequences of known bovine MHCI gene cDNAs, as presented in the IPD-MHC database (May 2014), was used to design a series of 3_ (for) and 5_ (rev) pan-MHCI primers. cDNA from individual animals was subject to PCR amplification in two separate reactions using either the For1/Rev2 or the For3/Rev1 primer pairs. For each sample primers using a unique combination of MID tags were used to allow subsequent de-multiplexing of the sequence data. PCRs were conducted using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR kit. Following amplification, 5?_l of PCR products from each sample were pooled, purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads and run on a 1.5?% agarose gel. Bands of the appropriate size  were extracted and purified using the Qiagen Gel extraction kit. Libraries were submitted to Edinburgh Genomics where after standard quality control procedures they underwent 300 base paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq v3. Data were separated into reads generated from For1Rev2 and For3Rev1 primer pairs, generating separate datasets for up to 192 samples. Within each sample, reads were clustered into unique variants which were subsequently compared using BLAST against a database of the previously identified bovine MHCI sequences. This process identified >140 novel classical MHCI genes and defined 62 novel MHCI haplotypes, dramatically expanding the known bovine MHCI repertoire."

OBI:9999994	chromium release assay			An in vitro cell killing assay in which radioactive chromium is absorbed by cells and released into supernatant when the cells die. The amount of radioactivity measured in the supernatant is a proxy for the number of cells that have died.	IEDB	"Autologous EBV-transformed B-LCL were used as target cells for the influenza virus-specific CTL assays. Equal volumes of target and effector cells were added to triplicate wells of 96-well tissue culture plates, and 1:2 serial dilutions of effectors were made, producing effector-to-target (E:T) ratios of 100:1, 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1. After a 4-h incubation of the effector cells with the target cells, supernatants were collected following brief centrifugation and transferred to polystyrene tubes to be counted with the LKB 1272 Clinigamma counter (Wallac). Percent specific killing was determined with the following equation: (experimental 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release)/(maximum 51Cr release - spontaneous 51Cr release) x 100."
