OBI:0000115	intervention design	intervention design	pending final vetting		An intervention design is a study design in which a controlled process applied to the subjects (the intervention) serves as the independent variable manipulated by the experimentalist. The treatment (perturbation or intervention) defined can be defined as a combination of values taken by independent variable manipulated by the experimentalists are applied to the recruited subjects assigned (possibly by applying specific methods) to treatment groups. The specificity of intervention design is the fact that independent variables are being manipulated and a response of the biological system is evaluated via response variables as monitored by possibly a series of assays.

We aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying FFA-induced insulin resistance in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy. Research Design and Methods: Using a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design, we studied the effects of an overnight acipimox-induced suppression of FFA on glucose and FFA metabolism by using stable isotope labelled tracer techniques during basal conditions and a two-stage euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp (20 mU insulin/m(2)/min; 50 mU insulin/m(2)/min) in nine patients with nondiabetic HIV-lipodystrophy. All patients received antiretroviral therapy. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained during each stage of the clamp. Results: Acipimox treatment reduced basal FFA rate of appearance by 68.9% (52.6%-79.5%) and decreased plasma FFA concentration by 51.6 % (42.0%-58.9%), (both, P < 0.0001). Endogenous glucose production was not influenced by acipimox. During the clamp the increase in glucose-uptake was significantly greater after acipimox treatment compared to placebo (acipimox: 26.85 (18.09-39.86) vs placebo: 20.30 (13.67-30.13) mumol/kg/min; P < 0.01). Insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt (Thr(308)) and GSK-3beta (Ser(9)), decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase (GS) site 3a+b and increased GS-activity (I-form) in skeletal muscle (P < 0.01). Acipimox decreased phosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) (P < 0.02) and increased GS-activity (P < 0.01) in muscle. Conclusion: The present study provides direct evidence that suppression of lipolysis in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy improves insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose-uptake. The increased glucose-uptake may in part be explained by increased dephosphorylation of GS (site 3a+b) resulting in increased GS activity.

However, only 0.9% of these patients have suffered a cervical spine fracture. Current use of radiography is not efficient. The Canadian C-Spine Rule is designed to allow physicians to be more selective and accurate in ordering C-spine radiography, and to rapidly clear the C-spine without the need for radiography in many patients. The goal of this phase III study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an active strategy to implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule into physician practice. Specific objectives are to: 1) determine clinical impact, 2) determine sustainability, 3) evaluate performance, and 4) conduct an economic evaluation. METHODS: We propose a matched-pair cluster design study that compares outcomes during three consecutive 12-months before, after, and decay periods at six pairs of intervention and control sites. These 12 hospital ED sites will be stratified as teaching or community hospitals, matched according to baseline C-spine radiography ordering rates, and then allocated within each pair to either intervention or control groups. During the after period at the intervention sites, simple and inexpensive strategies will be employed to actively implement the Canadian C-Spine Rule. The following outcomes will be assessed: 1) measures of clinical impact, 2) performance of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and 3) economic measures. During the 12-month decay period, implementation strategies will continue, allowing us to evaluate the sustainability of the effect. We estimate a sample size of 4,800 patients in each period in order to have adequate power to evaluate the main outcomes. DISCUSSION: Phase I successfully derived the Canadian C-Spine Rule and phase II confirmed the accuracy and safety of the rule, hence, the potential for physicians to improve care. What remains unknown is the actual change in clinical behaviors that can be affected by implementation of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and whether implementation can be achieved with simple and inexpensive measures. We believe that the Canadian C-Spine Rule has the potential to significantly reduce health care costs and improve the efficiency of patient flow in busy Canadian EDs.

Presently, vitreous tamponades such as gas or silicone oil cannot contact the lower part of the retina. A heavier-than-water tamponade displaces the inflammatory and PVR-stimulating environment from the inferior area of the retina. The Heavy Silicone Oil versus Standard Silicone Oil Study (HSO Study) is designed to answer the question of whether a heavier-than-water tamponade improves the prognosis of eyes with PVR of the lower retina. Methods: The HSO Study is a multicentre, randomized, prospective controlled clinical trial comparing two endotamponades within a two-arm parallel group design. Patients with inferiorly and posteriorly located PVR are randomized to either heavy silicone oil or standard silicone oil as a tamponading agent. Three hundred and fifty consecutive patients are recruited per group. After intraoperative re-attachment, patients are randomized to either standard silicone oil (1000 cSt or 5000 cSt) or Densiron((R)) as a tamponading agent. The main endpoint criteria are complete retinal attachment at 12 months and change of visual acuity (VA) 12 months postoperatively compared with the preoperative VA. Secondary endpoints include complete retinal attachment before endotamponade removal, quality of life analysis and the number of retina affecting re-operation within 1 year of follow-up. Results: The design and early recruitment phase of the study are described. Conclusions: The results of this study will uncover whether or not heavy silicone oil improves the prognosis of eyes with PVR.	Philippe Rocca-Serra					subclass	study design						
OBI:0500007	randomized complete block design	randomized complete block design	pending final vetting		A randomized complete block design is_a study design which assigns randomly treatments to block. The number of units per block equals the number of treatment so each block receives each treatment exactly once (hence the qualifier 'complete'). The design was originally devised from field trials used in agronomy and agriculture. The analysis assumes that there is no interaction between block and treatment. The method was then used in other settings So The randomised complete block design is a design in which the subjects are matched according to a variable which the experimenter wishes to control. The subjects are put into groups (blocks) of the same size as the number of treatments. The members of each block are then randomly assigned to different treatment groups.	http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/ranblock.htm	http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/steps/glossary/anova.html,(A researcher is carrying out a study of the effectiveness of four different skin creams for the treatment of a certain skin disease.

Six lactating Holstein cows averaging 44 d in milk were used in a 6 x 6 Latin square design with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments: DCAD of -3, 22, or 47 milliequivalents (Na + K - Cl - S)/100 g of dry matter (DM), and 16 or 19% CP on a DM basis. Linear increases with DCAD occurred in DM intake, milk fat percentage, 4% fat-corrected milk production, milk true protein, milk lactose, and milk solids-not-fat. Milk production itself was unaffected by DCAD. Jugular venous blood pH, base excess and HCO3(-) concentration, and urine pH increased, but jugular venous blood Cl- concentration, urine titratable acidity, and net acid excretion decreased linearly with increasing DCAD. An elevated ratio of coccygeal venous plasma essential AA to nonessential AA with increasing DCAD indicated that N metabolism in the rumen was affected, probably resulting in more microbial protein flowing to the small intestine. Cows fed 16% CP had lower urea N in milk than cows fed 19% CP; the same was true for urea N in coccygeal venous plasma and urine. Dry matter intake, milk production, milk composition, and acid-base status did not differ between the 16 and 19% CP treatments. It was concluded that DCAD affected DM intake and performance of dairy cows in early lactation. Feeding 16% dietary CP to cows in early lactation, compared with 19% CP, maintained lactation performance while reducing urea N excretion in milk and urine.

Using the same food intake data and the expanded National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute food composition data base, these analyses of sources of variance have been expanded to include classes of carbohydrate, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, total ash, caffeine, and crude fiber. The analyses relate to observed intakes (replicated six times) of 30 adult males and 30 adult females obtained under a paired Graeco-Latin square design with sequence of interview, interviewer, and day of the week as determinants. Neither sequence nor interviewer made consistent contribution to variance. In females, day of the week had a significant effect for several nutrients. The major partitioning of variance was between interindividual variation (between subjects) and intraindividual variation (within subjects) which included both true day-to-day variation in intake and methodological variation. For all except caffeine, the intraindividual variability of 1-day data was larger than the interindividual variability. For vitamin A, almost all of the variance was associated with day-to-day variability. One day data provide a very inadequate estimate of usual intake of individuals. In the design of nutrition studies it is critical that the intended use of dietary data be a major consideration in deciding on methodology. There is no ideal dietary method. There may be preferred methods for particular purposes.	Philippe Rocca-Serra		only 2 articles in pubmed ->probably irrelevant			subclass	randomized complete block design

OBI:0500014	factorial design		pending final vetting		factorial design is_a study design which is used to evaluate two or more factors simultaneously. The treatments are combinations of levels of the factors. The advantages of factorial designs over one-factor-at-a-time experiments is that they are more efficient and they allow interactions to be detected. In statistics, a factorial design experiment is an experiment whose design consists of two or more factors, each with discrete possible values or levels, and whose experimental units take on all possible combinations of these levels across all such factors. Such an experiment allows studying the effect of each factor on the response variable, as well as the effects of interactions between factors on the response variable.	http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/steps/glossary/anova.html#facdes And from wikipedia (01/03/2007): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment)	PMID: 17582121-Our objective was to examine the effects of dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) with different concentrations of dietary crude protein (CP) on performance and acid-base status in early lactation cows.

Four groups of rats were arranged in a 2x2 factorial design with 2 levels of Social procedure (Intermittent Social vs Continuous Social) and 2 levels of sipper Liquid (Ethanol vs Water). Intermittent Social groups received 35 trials per session. Each trial consisted of the insertion of the sipper tube for 10 s followed by lifting of the guillotine door for 15 s. The guillotine door separated the experimental rat from the conspecific rat in the wire mesh cage during the 60 s inter-trial interval. The Continuous Social groups received similar procedures except that the guillotine door was raised during the entire duration of the session. For the Ethanol groups, the concentrations of ethanol in the sipper [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16% (vol/vol)] increased across sessions, while the Water groups received 0% ethanol (water) in the sipper throughout the experiment. Both Social procedures induced more intake of ethanol than water. The Intermittent Social procedure induced more ethanol intake at the two highest ethanol concentration blocks (10-12% and 14-16%) than the Continuous Social procedure, but this effect was not observed with water. Effects of social stimulation on ethanol drinking are discussed.	Philippe Rocca-Serra					subclass	factorial design

This design, however, is relatively expensive and labor-intensive. We propose a self-self hybridization design as an alternative to the dye swap design. In this design, the treated and control samples are labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 (or Cy3 and Cy5), respectively, without dye swap, along with a set of self-self hybridizations on the control sample. We compare this design with the dye swap design through investigation of mouse primary hepatocytes treated with three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) agonists at three dose levels. Using Agilent's Whole Mouse Genome microarray, differentially expressed genes (DEG) were determined for both the self-self hybridization and dye swap designs. The DEG concordance between the two designs was over 80% across each dose treatment and chemical. Furthermore, 90% of DEG-associated biological pathways were in common between the designs, indicating that biological interpretations would be consistent.

MO_887	PMID: 14744830-Microarrays are powerful tools for surveying the expression levels of many thousands of genes simultaneously. They belong to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources.
