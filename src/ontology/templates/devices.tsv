OBI:0000489	nitrogen phosphorous detector	nitrogen phosphorous detector	metadata complete		The nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the FID. Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01089|WEB:<http://www.chromatography-online.org/topics/nitrogen/phosphorus/detector.html>		PERSON:Daniel Schober						gas chromatography detector

OBI:0000495	vacuum degasser	vacuum degasser	metadata complete		A degassing system used for degassing solvents in liquid chromatography. Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.

OBI:0000506	photoionization detector	photoionization detector	metadata complete	PID	The selective determination of aromatic hydrocarbons or organo-heteroatom species is the job of the photoionization detector (PID). This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis.	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01090|WEB:<http://www.chemistry.adelaide.edu.au/external/soc-rel/content/pid.htm>		PERSON:Daniel Schober						gas chromatography detector

There is an electrode above the flame to collect the ions formed at a hydrogen/air flame. The number of ions hitting the collector is measured and a signal is generated. Flame ionization detectors are most widely used and generally applicable for gas chromatography and hence is used for routine and general purpose analysis.

OBI:0000528	liquid chromatography valve	liquid chromatography valve	metadata complete		A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01110|WEB:<http://www.chromatography-online.org/EC-Dispersion/HPLC-Sample-Valves/rs16.html>		PERSON:Daniel Schober		chromatography device				chromatography device

OBI:0000536	fraction collector	fraction collector	metadata complete		A fraction detector is a device that allows regular or specified samples to be taken from a column eluate and stored in a retrievable form. The storage vessels are usually small sample tubes or vials that are oriented in a rotating disk or in a moving belt, there movement usually being controlled by a microprocessor. On receiving a signal from the microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs. They are used to collect samples for further purification, subsequent examination by spectroscopic techniques or for biological or organoleptic testing.

Thus, the electrical conductivity detector a bulk property detector. and senses all ions whether they are from a solute or from the mobile phase. In order to prevent polarization of the sensing electrodes, AC voltages must be used and so it is the impedance not the resistance of the electrode system that is actually measured. From a physical chemistry stand point the conductivity of a solution is more important than its resistance. However, it is the resistance (impedance) of the electrode system that determines the current across it. The resistance of any conductor varies directly as its length and inversely as its cross sectional area.

OBI:0000568	piston-seal	piston-seal	metadata complete		The seal made by a piston in a diaphragm pump. The unique property of the reciprocating diaphragm pump is that the actuating piston does not come into direct contact with the mobile phase and thus, the demands on the piston-cylinder seal are not so great. The diaphragm has a relatively high surface area and thus, the movement of the diaphragm is relatively small and consequently the pump can be operated at a fairly high frequency. High frequency pumping results in a very significant reduction in pulse amplitude and, in addition, high frequency pulses are more readily damped by the column system. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that diaphragm pumps are not pulseless.	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01116|WEB:<http://www.chromatography-online.org/HPLC/Basic-HPLC/Pump/Diaphragm/rs15.html>		PERSON:Daniel Schober						chromatography consumable

The emitting species for sulfur compounds is excited S2. The lambda max for emission of excited S2 is approximately 394 nm. The emitter for phosphorus compounds in the flame is excited HPO (lambda max = doublet 510-526 nm). In order to selectively detect one or the other family of compounds as it elutes from the GC column, an interference filter is used between the flame and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to isolate the appropriate emission band.

Pulsed Electrochemical Detection (PED) allows simple, sensitive, and direct detection of numerous polar aliphatic compounds, especially carbohydrates. This technique exploits the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal electrode surfaces to oxidize various polar functional groups. In PED, multi-step potential-time waveforms at Au and Pt electrodes realize amperometric/coulometric detection while maintaining uniform and reproducible electrode activity. The response mechanisms in PED are dominated by the surface properties of the electrode, and, as a consequence, members of each chemical class of compounds produce virtually identical voltammetric responses. Thus, the full potential is realized when combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

The conversion of nearly all nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds to their respective chemiluminescent species for universal nitrogen and sulfur detection has made nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection the most widely used analytical methods based upon ozone-induced chemiluminescence. In addition to non-chromatographic applications, nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection has been adapted to various chromatographic techniques from gas chromatography to liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography as specialized element-specific detectors. The characteristics of these detectors are evaluated and compared to other element-selective detection techniques. The unique features of the chemiluminescence detectors have made them powerful tools in many diverse fields of analytical chemistry.	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01088|WEB:<http://sangerhinxtongbr.library.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/00219673/1999/00000842/00000001/art00177>		PERSON:Daniel Schober						gas chromatography detector

Frits are porous metal products to prevent unwanted particles from entering the chromatography system. These particles may come from the sample, the solvent or debris generated by the chromatography system itself. Such particles entering the system may lead to clogging of capillaries, interference with the chromatography by changing chromatographic parameters or disturbance of the detector function. Characteristics of a frit, besides the diameter and the thickness, is the porosity (pore distribution, density).	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01070|WEB:<http://www.chromatography-online.org/topics/radial/columns.html>		PERSON:Daniel Schober		chromatography device				chromatography device

OBI:0000605	chart recorder	chart recorder	metadata complete		The chart recorder is a device that transduces signal-intensities into a graphical peak output: As the separated components of the gas sample emerge into the detector, the change in voltage in the detecting bridge circuit causes a representative peak to be drawn on a chart recorder. The position of the peak along the time axis of the chart measures the component's retention time, which identifies the component. This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration.	http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/ontology/CHROM.owl#msi_01069|GROUP:<http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net>		PERSON:Daniel Schober		chromatography device				chromatography device

Unfortunately, the fraction taken in this way may not be representative of the original sample. This is due to the individual solutes in the mixture having different diffusivities and, thus, they distribute themselves across the sampling tube in an irregular manner. In general, the components with higher diffusivities (e.g., those solutes of lower molecular weight) will diffuse away from the bulk sample more quickly than those having lower diffusivities.

OBI:0000628	carbon nanotube column	carbon nanotube column	metadata complete		Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are known to have high thermal and mechanical stability and have the potential to be high-performance separation media that utilize the nanoscale interactions. CNT can be applied in long capillary tubes for the development of gas chromatography columns. A film of CNTs can be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to form the stationary phase in the open tubular format. Altering the CVD conditions can vary the thickness and the morphology of the CNT film, which opens the possibility of selectivity tuning. The ability to fabricate long tubes coated with CNTs can be readily employed in other gas- and liquid-phase separations as well.

OBI:0000642	atomic emission detector	atomic emission detector	metadata complete	AED	Instead of measuring simple gas phase (carbon containing) ions created in a flame as with the flame ionization detector, or the change in background current because of electronegative element capture of thermal electrons as with the electron capture detector, the AED has a much wider applicability because it is based on the detection of atomic emissions. The strength of the AED lies in the detector's ability to simultaneously determine the atomic emissions of many of the elements in analytes that elute from a GC capillary column (called eluants or solutes in some books). As eluants come off the capillary column they are fed into a microwave powered plasma (or discharge) cavity where the compounds are destroyed and their atoms are excited by the energy of the plasma. The light that is emitted by the excited particles is separated into individual lines via a photodiode array. The associated computer then sorts out the individual emission lines and can produce chromatograms made up of peaks from eluants that contain only a specific element.

This trap is designed to stop an arthropod in flight, causing it to fall into the liquid and die.	VSMO:0001649	Jonsson developed a free-standing window trap consisting of a 16 x 20-cm perspex box, 16 cm high and divided in the middle by a 20 x 36-cm sheet of perspex (window).  The two compartments of the box are filled to a depth of about 12 cm with 4-6% formalin containing a few drops of detergent; in winter ethylene glycol can be added to prevent freezing.  One or two holes drilled in one side of the box at 12 cm and covered with fine netting prevent the trap overflowing after heavy rain.  Traps are mounted on aluminium poles.  Flying insects on hitting the transparent vertical plastic window fall into the formalin.  The window trap may catch vectors that are seeking a host or moving for other purposes.

OBI:0003050	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gravid trap			CDC gravid trap	A gravid trap that consists of a pan holding a hay infusion, motorized fan, and collection bag. This trap is designed to attract gravid female arthropods to the infused material, which would serve as an oviposition medium, and then draw them into the bag with the current generated by the fan.	VSMO:0001510	The original trap CDC gravid trap (or gravid trap of Reiter) consists of a 3 inch diameter PVC inlet tube housing a 6 V motor, as used in CDC traps, on which is mounted a four-bladed 3 inch counter-clockwise fan. The inlet tube is clamped between two vertical wooden boards that fit over a black plastic box (18.5 x 14.0 x 6.5 inches). A plastic 12 inch long PVC chimney slots into the upper end of the inlet tube. The top half consists of three struts that fit into and support a netting collecting bag. For this the middle of the collecting bag is reinforced with a circular patch of denim cloth. The oviposition attractant is made by adding 1 lb of hay and 1 oz each of dried brewer's yeast and lactalbumen powder to 30 gallons of tap water. This infusion is allowed to mature for 5 days. This original gravid mosquito trap of Reiter suffers from certain limitations, namely up to 10% of the catch of adults is damaged by passing through the fan blades, and adults tend to die of desiccation.

OBI:0400009	arc lamp	arc lamp	metadata incomplete		Arc lamp is a light source that produces light by an electric arc (or voltaic arc). The lamp consists of two electrodes typically made of tungsten which are separated by a gas. The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interrogation point.	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_lamp	The Jablochkoff Candle	John Quinn						light source
